# Better Lightbox [Stash Plugin]
[Stash](https://github.com/stashapp) plugin that enhances the image lightbox, especially for mobile, one-handed use, similar to the mobile beta UI of [ImageFap](https://beta.imagefap.com/).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This plugin is a WIP and still misses enhancements (pan & zoom is still an issue) and some polish.

> [!TIP]
> Use a default saved filter to open images in wall view by default.

> [!TIP]
> Not all themes include the "Images" tab on their mobile UI. The default one does.
