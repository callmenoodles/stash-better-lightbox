# Better Lightbox [Stash Plugin]
[Stash](https://github.com/stashapp) plugin that enhances the image lightbox, especially for mobile, one-handed use, similar to the mobile beta UI of [ImageFap](https://beta.imagefap.com/).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This plugin is a WIP and still misses enhancements (pan & zoom is still an issue) and some polish.

> [!TIP]
> Use a default saved filter to open images in wall view by default.

## Installation
Stash provides an official [guide](https://docs.stashapp.cc/in-app-manual/plugins/?h=plugin#adding-plugins-manually) to install plugins manually.
